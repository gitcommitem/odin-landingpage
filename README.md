## Learnings

Tried to stay similar to the given design in layout, though I did add or change a few things.

Learning how to code a "fake" full width section was interesting and I would be curious of more elegant solutions. The solution I used was padding-left and padding-right set to 100vw which were then offset with -100vw margins in the corresponding directions.

Regarding writing CSS, definitely seeing the usefulness in reset.css stylesheets (I didn't use one for this project, but now understand why they are popular to include.) I definitely think there's room for me to consolidate my CSS in places and be more mindful of the groupings.

Would like to do a redesign of this landing page in the future that's not tied to the above page design.
